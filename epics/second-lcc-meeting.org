So, we went to the lcc to meet with Mike.
Some email specific days.
Four a month required for committed people. (39 shifts)
2s and 3s are roughly the same, 1s are low-low
Blanks happen, they call people to try to fill them.
Try to evenly space volunteers throughout the month. (aka, fewer double-shifts and such)
Special requests, such as can't do certian days, are made.
Typically once a week, four a month.
Majority are required to work 39 for some reason.
